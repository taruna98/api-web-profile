Not only that, <b>Infinityfree</b> also offers <i>SMTP</i> feature in its free service. From my experience, at the end of <b>2021</b>, I created an account for <b>0 rupiah</b>, meaning it was free, which I used to host a project form that also utilized the <i>SMTP</i> feature, and it ran smoothly.</p><p>After leaving the project at the end of <b>2021</b>, a few days ago, I remembered this project. When I tried to access it, it turned out to still be usable, although I didn't check the <i>SMTP</i> feature in-depth. This means that the <b>free account usage period</b> on this hosting service seems to be <b>very long</b>.</p><img class=\"w-100\" src=\"https://forum-cdn.infinityfree.net/original/3X/8/e/8eef63ff05a4bf2e41481e0c6c1afea9559aa5d8.jpeg\" alt=\"Infinityfree\"><p>In this article, I might want to recommend this hosting service for you free enthusiasts.
